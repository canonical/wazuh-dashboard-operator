type: charm
# Use upcoming ST124 syntax
# To pack this charm, a temporary compatibility wrapper https://github.com/canonical/charmcraftst124
# is required until ST124 support is added to charmcraft
# (ST124 syntax is needed to enable multi-base charms with Ubuntu 24.04. We use ST124 syntax across
# all of our charms [even those that aren't multi base] for consistency and to simplify CI/CD
# maintenance & tooling)
