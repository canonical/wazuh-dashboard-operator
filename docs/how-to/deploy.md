# Deploy the Opensearch Dashboards charm

Please follow the [Tutorial](dashboards-tutorial) for detailed instructions on
how to deploy the charm on LXD.

Below is a summary of the commands (assuming that instructions from OpenSearch Documentation
[Set kernel parameters](https://canonical-charmed-opensearch.readthedocs-hosted.com/2/tutorial/1-set-up-the-environment/#set-kernel-parameters)
were applied):

```shell
juju add-model test

cat <<EOF > cloudinit-userdata.yaml
cloudinit-userdata: |
  postruncmd:
    - [ 'sysctl', '-w', 'vm.max_map_count=262144' ]
    - [ 'sysctl', '-w', 'vm.swappiness=0' ]
    - [ 'sysctl', '-w', 'net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=5' ]
    - [ 'sysctl', '-w', 'fs.file-max=1048576' ]
EOF

juju model-config --file cloudinit-userdata.yaml

juju deploy opensearch --channel=2/edge --config profile="testing"
juju deploy self-signed-certificates

juju relate  self-signed-certificates opensearch

juju deploy opensearch-dashboards --channel=2/edge
juju relate opensearch opensearch-dashboards
juju relate self-signed-certificates opensearch-dashboards
```

As a result, a healthy system should look something like this:
