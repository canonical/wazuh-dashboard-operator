# How to access OpenSearch Dashboards using OAuth

This guide shows how to configure OpenSearch Dashboards to support single sign-on (SSO)
using the [Canonical Identity Platform](https://canonical-identity.readthedocs-hosted.com/).
The platform is a Charm bundle that includes an identity provider (Hydra),
an identity broker (Kratos), an ingress (Traefik), and a login-ui application.
By the end, you will be able to sign in to OpenSearch Dashboards with an admin user created in Kratos.

## Prerequisites

* A deployed charmed OpenSearch cluster on LXD.
* A deployed charmed OpenSearch Dashboards on LXD and integrated with OpenSearch.
See: [How to Connect to OpenSearch](dashboard-how-to-connect-to-opensearch).
* A deployed Canonical Identity Platform on Kubernetes.
* Working Integration between OpenSearch and Canonical Identity Platform through certificates
and Hydra OAuth interface.
See: [How to access OpenSearch using OAuth](https://canonical-charmed-opensearch.readthedocs-hosted.com/2/how-to/access-using-oauth/).

```{note}
If using MicroK8s, run LXD and MicroK8s under the same Juju controller. Using separate controllers may cause failures during integration. If you must use two controllers, configure a new one for MicroK8s as follows:
```

```shell
# Export microk8s config
microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config

# Replace localhost IP by the computer public IP
export LOCAL_IP="127.0.0.1"
export PUBLIC_IP=$(ip -4 -j route get 2.2.2.2 | jq -r '.[] | .prefsrc')
sed -i 's/'${LOCAL_IP}'/'${PUBLIC_IP}'/g' ~/.kube/config

# Create new cloud using modified config
cat ~/.kube/config | juju add-k8s microk8s-cluster --cluster-name=microk8s-cluster --client

# Bootstrap the microk8s controller
juju bootstrap microk8s-cluster k8s-controller
```

## Deploy OpenSearch dashboards

On the LXD model where OpenSearch is deployed, deploy OpenSearch Dashboards,
and integrate it with OpenSearch charm.

```shell
juju deploy opensearch-dashboards --channel=2/edge
juju integrate opensearch opensearch-dashboards
```

Now, we will wait for the OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards to become active and ready.

```shell
juju status --watch 2s 
```

<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = NO -->
## Integrate OpenSearch dashboards with Canonical Identity Platform
<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

Switch to the MicroK8s model and verify the identity platform bundle is ready:

```shell
juju switch oauth
juju status
```

</details>

All the components of the bundle must be active except `kratos-external-idp-integrator`.
It will be in blocked status.

Switch back to LXD and integrate OpenSearch Dashboards with the interface offered
by self-signed-certificates from OAuth model, and with the OAuth interface provided by Hydra.

```shell
juju switch lxd
juju integrate opensearch-dashboards:certificates self-signed-certificates:certificates
juju integrate opensearch-dashboards:oauth hydra:oauth
```

## Create an admin account

We will now create an admin account using Kratos.
This command will require an email and username, and will give the password reset
link as well as the reset code.

```shell
juju run kratos/0 create-admin-account email=myuser@example.com username=myuser
Running operation 7 with 1 task
  - task 8 on unit-kratos-0

Running operation 1 with 1 task
  - task 2 on unit-kratos-0

Waiting for task 2...
15:39:52 Creating admin account.
15:39:53 Successfully created admin account: 3b322477-6250-4606-b820-b32d679b3cff.
15:39:53 Creating recovery code for resetting admin password.

expires-at: "2025-09-25T16:39:52.595790816Z"
identity-id: 3b322477-6250-4606-b820-b32d679b3cff
password-reset-code: "868748"
password-reset-link: https://10.241.7.39/welcome-k8s-identity-platform-login-ui-operator/ui/reset_email?flow=a5966798-646b-46e7-ae6f-a466e30323a9
```

The output provides a password reset link and recovery code.
Open the link, enter the recovery code, and set a password.

Make sure to enter the recovery code given in the output of the previous command.
Once that is done you will be redirected to the password reset page,
where you specify the user’s password.

Once the password is set, you will then be prompted to configure 2FA (mandatory).

## Access OpenSearch dashboards using single sign-on

To access OpenSearch Dashboards, use the IP address on the `opensearch-dashboards/0`
unit to form the URL: `https://<ip-address>:5601`.

Once the account is ready, open OpenSearch Dashboards.
A **Log in with single sign-on** button will appear.

```

Click the button to open the identity platform login UI.
You will get redirected to the identity platform UI login screen where you will be
prompted to enter the email and password.

```

If it is your first time connecting, it will also ask for the 2FA code.

After a successful login, you will be redirected to the OpenSearch Dashboards home screen.
