# Wazuh Dashboard documentation
<!-- vale Canonical.007-Headings-sentence-case = YES -->

The [Wazuh Dashboard](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/wazuh-dashboard/index.html)
is a component for analyzing and visualizing security data data based on [OpenSearch](http://opensearch.org/). Consequently,
this charm is a  [Charmed OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/canonical/opensearch-dashboards-operator) fork.

When deployed and integrated with the [Wazuh Server charm](https://charmhub.io/wazuh-server),
the Wazuh Dashboard charm expands the capabilities that the OpenSearch Dashboards charm would provide. See the Server charm's documentation for more details. 

For the complete documentation, refer to [upstream](https://charmhub.io/opensearch-dashboards).
